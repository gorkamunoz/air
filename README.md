Action Induced Representations (AIR)
================

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

This repository contains the **models, losses, and metrics** used in the
paper *Disentanglement by Action Induced Representations* (link to come)

## Installation

This package is built using
[nbdev](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/nbdev). Clone the repository and
install by running the following command:

``` bash
pip install /path/to/the/clone
```

### Requirements

The previous command will also ensure that all required libraries are
installed. The current version of the code has been developed using the
following versions:

``` bash
numpy == 2.2.5
scipy == 1.15.2
fastai == 2.8.1
torch == 2.6.0+cu124
scikit-learn == 1.6.1
jax == 0.6.0
```

## Examples

The `examples/` folder contains Jupyter notebooks that allow you to
reproduce the main experimental results of the paper and learn how to
train and evaluate VAIR models end-to-end.

We consider three example datasets:

- **Abstract:** A minimal synthetic environment designed to isolate and
  study the core inductive biases of AIR models.

- **Classical:** A classical control-style dataset with structured state
  transitions induced by discrete actions.

- **Quantum:** A dataset based on simulated quantum systems, where
  actions correspond to interventions on quantum states.
