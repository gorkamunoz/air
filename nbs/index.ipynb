    "This repository contains the **models, losses, and metrics** used in the paper *Disentanglement by Action Induced Representations* [(link)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2602.06741)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "This package is built using [nbdev](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/nbdev). Clone the repository and install by running the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install /path/to/the/clone\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous command will also ensure that all required libraries are installed. The current version of the code has been developed using the following versions: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "numpy == 2.2.5\n",
    "scipy == 1.15.2\n",
    "fastai == 2.8.1\n",
    "torch == 2.6.0+cu124\n",
    "scikit-learn == 1.6.1\n",
    "jax == 0.6.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "The `examples/` folder contains Jupyter notebooks that allow you to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper and learn how to train and evaluate VAIR models end-to-end. \n",
    "\n",
    "We consider three example datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Abstract:** A minimal synthetic environment designed to isolate and study the core inductive biases of AIR models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classical:** A classical control-style dataset with structured state transitions induced by discrete actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quantum:** A dataset based on simulated quantum systems, where actions correspond to interventions on quantum states.\n",
    "\n",
